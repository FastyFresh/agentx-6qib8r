## Introduction

Welcome to the AGENT AI Platform contribution guide! We're excited to have you join our community of contributors working to democratize AI agent creation through natural language interactions.

### Types of Contributions
- Feature development
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- Security enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Compliance implementations

### Security and Compliance Overview
All contributions must adhere to our zero-trust security model and maintain compliance with:
- GDPR
- SOC 2 Type II
- PCI DSS Level 1
- HIPAA
- ISO 27001

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup
1. Install required tools:
   - Docker 24.0+
   - Kubernetes 1.27+
   - Node.js 20 LTS
   - Python 3.11+
   - Go 1.20+

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentai/platform.git
cd platform
```

3. Configure security tools:
   - Install Trivy for container scanning
   - Configure Snyk for dependency scanning
   - Set up pre-commit hooks for security checks

4. Set up compliance validation:
   - Configure GDPR data handling checks
   - Enable SOC 2 compliance validation
   - Implement PCI DSS security controls

## Development Workflow
